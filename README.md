# COBOL-Tutorial
Hello, I'm Duke

**COBOL** - a 65-year-old language, yet it is used in large financial and banking systems.

Learning it is relatively difficult because it is little known and is almost as old as a human lifetime. Besides, in the past, we could only program on mainframe systemsâ€”something that individual programmers could hardly access

So I made a series of tutorials on programming this language on Windows 11 via WSL (Debian) and Visual Studio Code on the Dev Community page here https://dev.to/ngtduc693/series/29206

and this is a repository containing code snippets from the COBOL programming language tutorial series.
